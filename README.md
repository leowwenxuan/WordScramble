## Setup Guide
1. Clone the repository
2. Do a npm install the following dependenices:
    * [ExpressJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): A backend framework for which we will use to build the backend.
    * [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors): The website will be hosted on another server different from the one the backend will be hosted on. Thus, we need to do some permission configuration to allow request from a different origin. The CORS package will help us with the configuration.
- To ensure that you have the following dependencies installed, go to your `package.json` and check under the dependencies section.
